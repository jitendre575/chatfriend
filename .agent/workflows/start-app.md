description: How to start both the frontend and backend servers
---

To run the full application (Frontend + Backend), follow these steps:

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   In a new terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   *Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.*

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   In another terminal window, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Combined Command (Optional)**
   You can also add a concurrent script to your `package.json` to run both with one command.
